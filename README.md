# cactus-identification
Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network models to assist in the detection of a cactus species

## Outline
In this project, we are going to implement a CNN model for a Kaggle playground competition. The link to the competition is: https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification/. In this project, competitors are supposed to build a model that predicts whether the pictures contain a species of cactus.

## Data
The dataset was provided originally created by the VIGIA project (https://jivg.org/research-projects/vigia/), and simplified by Kaggle. All the data used in this project is contained in the `data` folder
