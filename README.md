# cactus-identification
Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network models to assist in the detection of a cactus species

## Outline
In this project, we are going to implement a CNN model for a Kaggle playground competition. The link to the competition is: https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification/. In this project, competitors are supposed to build a model that predicts whether the pictures contain a species of cactus, and evaluated it via the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve.

## Data
The provided dataset was originally created by the VIGIA project (https://jivg.org/research-projects/vigia/), and simplified by Kaggle. All the data used in this project can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification/data, or via the Kaggle API in https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api
